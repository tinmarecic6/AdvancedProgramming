This is the  exam bundle, minus the actual questions. The setup is the same as
in the homework assignments.  Use it to test your laptop  setup; though it
should work, if the assignments worked  for you.  The intro text is the same,
so you can read it before the actual exam, and jump directly into question Q1
when the exam opens.
